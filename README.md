[00:21.47] I've got a river running right into you
[00:27.03] I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
[00:32.68] Something you say or something you do
[00:37.51] The taste of the divine
[00:49.01] 
[00:43.74] You've got my body, flesh and bone, yeah
[00:49.42] The sky above, the Earth below
[01:04.42] 
[00:54.51] Raise me up again
[01:05.36] Take me past the edge
[01:12.06] I want to see the other side
[01:26.06] 
[01:27.75] See the other side
[01:41.41] Aaah!
[01:43.91] 
[01:53.17] You've got my body, flesh and bone
[01:58.52] The sky above, the Earth below
[02:13.52] 
[02:26.19] Raise me up again
[02:36.93] Take me past the edge
[02:43.82] I want to see the other side
[02:57.82] 
[02:55.67] Won't you show me what it's like?
[03:06.59] Won't you show me what it's like?
[03:23.09] 
[05:02.10] Oh, and my love
[05:05.91] Did I mistake you for a sign from God
[05:11.43] Or are you really here to cut me off?
[05:17.22] Or maybe just to turn me on
[05:24.30] 'Cause these days
[05:28.19] I would be lying if I told you that
[05:33.66] I didn't wish that I could be your man
[05:39.56] Or maybe make a good girl bad
[05:54.06] 
[05:47.74] I've got a river running right into you
[05:53.11] I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
[05:58.67] Something you say or something you do
[06:03.11] The taste of the divine
[06:14.61] 
[06:09.62] You've got my body, flesh and bone
[06:15.34] The sky above, the Earth below
[06:20.74] Nothing to say and nowhere to go
[06:25.31] The taste of the divine
