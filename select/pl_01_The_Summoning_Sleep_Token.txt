I've got a river running right
into you
I've got a blood trail,
red in the blue
Something you say or
something you do
The taste of the divine
You've got my body,
flesh and bone, yeah
The sky above, the Earth below
Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side
See the other side
You've got my body,
flesh and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side
Won't you show me
what it's like?
Won't you show me
what it's like?
Oh, and my love
Did I mistake you
for a sign from God
Or are you really here
to cut me off?
Or maybe just to turn me on?
'Cause these days
I would be lying
if I told you that
I didn't wish that
I could be your man
Or maybe make a good girl bad
I've got a river running right
into you
I've got a blood trail,
red in the blue
Something you say or
something you do
The taste of the divine
You've got my body,
flesh and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
Nothing to say and nowhere to go
The taste of the divine
